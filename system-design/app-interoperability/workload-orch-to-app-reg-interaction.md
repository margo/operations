# Application Registry

This section describes the Application Registry and the exchange of an [application package](./application-package-definition.md) from an Application Developer to the Workload Orchestration Vendor. 

The Application Developer SHALL use a [Git repository](https://git-scm.com/) to share an [application package](./application-package-definition.md). This Git repository is considered the Application Registry. 

The connectivity between the Workload Orchestration Software and the Application Registry SHALL be read-only. 

Upon installation request from the End User, the Workload Orchestration Vendor SHALL retrieve the [application package](./application-package-definition.md) using a ``git pull`` request from the Application Registry. 

The Workload Orchestration Vendor reads in the application description file, ``margo.yaml``, and presents a user interface that allows the specification of parameters available according to ``margo.yaml``. 

The End User then specifies the configuration parameters for the [application package](./application-package-definition.md). 

Then, the [application package](./application-package-definition.md) is ready to be passed on to the installation process.  

> **Note** 
> The specifics of the installation process are still under discussion: this could be for example a GitOps based approach. 

During this process the containers referenced in the application manifest ([Helm Chart](https://helm.sh/docs/) or [Docker Compose](https://github.com/compose-spec/compose-spec/blob/master/03-compose-file.md)) are retrieved from container/Helm registries. 

At a minimum, a Margo-compliant WOS SHALL provide a way for an end user to manually setup a connection between the WOS and an application registry. This is required so as not to prohibit an end user for being able to install any Margo-compliant application they wish; including applications developed by the end user. 

The Workload Orchestration Vendor MAY provide enhanced user experience options such as the pre-configuring of application registries to monitor. These can include application registries from third-party application vendors or their own applications. 

## Secure Access to the Application Package 

It is expected the connection between the Workload Orchestration software and the Application developerâ€™s application registry is secured using standard secure connectivity best practices. Some standard practices include the following: 

- Basic authentication via HTTPS 
- Bearer token authentication 
- TLS certifications
